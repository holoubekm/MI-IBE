## Informační bezpečnost
### CTU / ČVUT FIT

#### Semestral work
Everybody got a topic touching information security assigned and was about to write a text. My topic was `Medialized attack on information systems of companies, institutions and states`.

Unfortunately the whole text is written in the Czech language (to keep you out of business :D)

In the text I try to sum up different attacks, compare them mutually and let readers to make their own opinions.
